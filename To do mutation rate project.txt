To do mutation rate project:

Environment:
-Current = uniform
-Implement = autocorrelated & skewed (normal?)

Model versions:
-Neutral version (coupled/uncoupled)
-Single mutation rate version (demolished from current, study coupled/uncoupled)
-Plastic mutation rate version (current, study only uncoupled)
-Bet hedging version (no detection of environment, instead switch locus is coin toss, study only uncoupled)

Technical side:
-Cluster operation, keep loops over paramters, parallelize over seeds, add seed to CSV output, take out seed loop

Parameters to loop over: Environmental change rate (keep current), coupled uncoupled (for single), switchpoint (3 values, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9) , mutA/mutB (mid, low , high, each all permutations), selection strength (2, 10), type of environment change.
